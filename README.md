# Final_Project_HMI_SR
- A full system for car drivers to make them do multiple actions with their voice commands
instead of using physical actions, this can be reliable and safe so they donâ€™t take their eyes off the road.
- The speech recognition system implemented using Raspberry Pi and output data processed by TM4C123GH6PM (Tiva C) LaunchPad ARM based microcontroller that controls the remaining system.
- The project design mainly transfers data using UART and CAN communication protocols.
- Application layer of the design contains HMI touch screen, Bluetooth and GPS modules.
